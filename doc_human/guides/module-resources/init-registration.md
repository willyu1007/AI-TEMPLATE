# Module Init - Registration

After scaffolding:
- Add entry to `doc_human/guides/MODULE_INSTANCES.md`.
- Update `doc_agent/orchestration/registry.yaml` if the module needs routing.
- Ensure ownership metadata is recorded (contacts, escalation path).
- Mention language policy when onboarding new owners.
