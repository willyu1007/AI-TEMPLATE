# Documentation Roles (Human View)

Refer to `doc_agent/policies/DOC_ROLES.md` for the AI-optimized version. This file reiterates expectations for human contributors.

| Doc Type | Owner | Expectations |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| AI Quickstarts | Automation owners | ¡Ü150 lines, English-only, actionable |
| Human Guides | Domain experts | Deep explanations, still English, objective |
| Module Docs | Module leads | Keep templates updated (contract, runbook, test plan, test data, progress) |
| Templates | Documentation guild | Mention language policy; keep placeholders clear |

Always set `audience`, `language`, and `purpose` in headers and verify the configured language before writing.
