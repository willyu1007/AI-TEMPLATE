# Goals

1. Build an AI-friendly development workflow with deterministic guardrails.
2. Keep documentation concise yet complete, fully translated into the configured language.
3. Ensure every change is testable, observable, and reversible.
4. Empower contributors to add modules quickly without breaking existing ones.

Use these goals when prioritizing work or evaluating new automation.
