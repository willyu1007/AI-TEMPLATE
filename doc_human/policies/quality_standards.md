# Quality Standards

- `make dev_check` must pass before merge.
- Guardrails cannot be bypassed without documented approval.
- Tests need ¡Ý80% coverage overall and ¡Ý90% for shared components.
- Observability hooks (logs, metrics, traces) required for each module.
- Documentation stays up to date and in the configured language.
- Workdocs capture context for every significant task.

Use this checklist during reviews and releases.
