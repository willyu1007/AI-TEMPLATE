Use ADRs to capture significant decisions, context, and consequences.

## Process
1. Create a new ADR file using the template (`adr/template.md`).
2. Fill in context, decision, and consequences.
3. Link related ADRs/workdocs.
4. Keep language consistent with `config/language.yaml`.

## Naming
`ADR-<sequence>-<short-title>.md`

## References
- `doc_human/adr/template.md`
- Workdocs for supporting evidence.
