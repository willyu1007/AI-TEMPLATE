# Repository Health Summary (Placeholder)

No generated health summary is currently committed. Run `make health_check` or `make health_report` to produce the latest `health-summary.md`, then summarize key risks inside your workdoc or PR description.

- Automation output path: `ai/maintenance_reports/health-summary.md`
- Retention: keep the freshest summary only; clean older files with `make cleanup_reports_smart`.
